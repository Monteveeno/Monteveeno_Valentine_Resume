                    My name is Monteveeno I am a Aspiring Software Developer, I love working with problems and solving them, I am team player and always trying to further my
                    experience in this industry, I love working with computers its the only place I spend most of time. We all need to start somewhere and climb the ladder of
                    success I am looking for an internship to begin this journey and better myself in this industry. My Objectives is to take myself from intermediate to advance,
                    The more I learn the better my skills will become in this industry and possibilities of always learning in this industry is astounding.
                    My objectives are to grow and not always look at money as a solution the first thing to do is love what you do before worrying about other obstacles and I have found my passion.
